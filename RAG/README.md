# 📄 Native PDF RAG Chatbot

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based PDF Question Answering System built using **Python, Streamlit, FAISS, Sentence Transformers, and the Groq API**.

This application enables users to upload PDF documents, convert them into semantic chunks, retrieve relevant information using semantic search, and generate context-aware answers using the **Groq Llama 3.3 model**.
